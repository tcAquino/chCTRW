# chCTRW

Chemical reaction dynamics based on the chemical continuous time random walk (chCTRW) generalized Gillespie algorithm accounting for non-exponential reaction delay. Includes examples for batch delay and advective streamtube dynamics.

## Dependencies

A compiler compatible with C++17 is required (for example, an up-to-date version of the gnu compiler g++ will do).

## Documentation
